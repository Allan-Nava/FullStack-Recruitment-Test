# FullStack Recruitment Test

## Section 1) Frontend 

Throught JSONPlaceholder API (https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/) build a web page that allow user to perform CRUD operations, considering that rendering and retrieval of the list support hugely large number of posts.

Use the /comments resources provided by JSONPlaceholder to render the comments of a post below it on click with some kind of animation.

Insert in the Readme file, documentation relating to the work done (ES: How to launch the application, Development pattern used...)

It is very important to document the progress of the work by updating the project whenever significant changes are made.

Extimated time job: 1 week from fork.

=================================================================

## Section 2) Backend

In the previous (*Frontend*) you reached out the JSONPlaceholder API to perform CRUD operations on the posts. Now, we ask you to *replace JSONPlaceholder with your custom backend*

Implement your own backend using a language and libraries of your choices. The only requirement is that the backend needs to support CRUD operations and can seamlessy replace JSONPlaceholder API in the challenge of Section 1)

=================================================================

## Section 3) Mobile

The requirements for this challenge are the exact same requirements of the Frontend challenge, but we ask you to fullfill these requirements through a mobile application
